\chapter*{Preface}
This report is a result of the course \textit{TMA4212 Numerical Solution of Differential Equations by Difference Methods} performed in the spring of 2021. The main learning outcome of this course is to gain experience with difference schemes for solving different types of partial differential equations. Moreover, a basic understanding of the finite element method is to be aquired. \newline

\noindent An important skill in the course is to be able to choose suitable numerical solvers for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. These solvers should be constructed, implemented and analyzed in order to verify that the solvers are implemented correctly, i.e. to verify that the constructed solvers can be used in practice. As a sidenote, equation solvers play an important role in effective implementations of these PDE-solvers. These skills are displayed in this report. \newline

\noindent Finally, a written presentation of scientific problems and of results obtained in project work should be practiced in this course. This practice and gain of experience emerges from the work with this report.

\chapter*{Abstract}
The main topic of this project report is examination of finite difference methods for solving different types of partial differential equations. \newline

\noindent Equations that are studied are Poisson's equation in one dimension with different boundary conditions, the heat equation, inviscid Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Laplace equation, the linearized Korteweg-deVries equation and the Sine-Gordon equation. Solvers of different orders are developed, implemented and analyzed for each of these equations. \newline

\noindent Simulations with uniform refinement, as well as some adaptive refinement methods, show that the numerical solutions converge, in different orders, to the analytical solutions.

\chapter{Introduction}

\noindent Part 1 of the project report consists of solving five different problems. The aim of this part is to dive deep into the material of the course and understand how the computations work through practical and theoretical experience. The problems consist of implementing finite difference methods for: (1) boundary value problems, (2) parabolic equations, (3) elliptic equations and (4) hyperbolic equations. The fifth and final problem consists of implementing the finite element method for a boundary value problem. Different boundary conditions are imposed in the different problems and the discretization for the numerical solutions vary from problem to problem. Convergence plots are constructed based on relative $L_2$- and $\ell_2$-norms in several of the problems, in order to quantify the convergence order of the difference schemes to the analytical solution in each case. \newline

\noindent Part 2 of the project report consists of an in-depth examination of the Sine-Gordon equation in the context of this course. The analytical solution of the equation is found and energy conservation is shown. Moreover, a semi-discretization method is constructed and used to solve the equation numerically. In order to implement this method, different Runge-Kutta and Runge-Kutta-Nyström schemes will be used to solve ODEs. Finally, a boundary value problem is solved numerically with some of the Runge-Kutta and Runge-Kutta-Nyström integrators. The results are reported and discussed. \newline

\noindent The simulations are executed in Python, since it is a high-level language that is easy to use. Python has an abundance of helpful packages that make visualization easy, and simulations can be performed relatively efficiently. For code efficiency, sparse matrix algebra modules are used to solve linear systems.
